### Fixed a security issue

- Fixed an issue where a specially crafted test file could inject unintended content into the website when loaded from an external source.
- This issue only affected test files obtained from untrusted sources. Files created within PDF2CBT or from trusted sources were not affected.
- Additional safeguards have been added to make loading external test files safer.
