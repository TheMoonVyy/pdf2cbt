### Added some configs in Pattern Based Cropper and fixed some layout related issues

In `Pattern Based Cropper`, added Allen DLP's JEE Main format (for both 90 Questions and 75 Questions format).

The configs added are for the PDF format where questions are in 2 languages, each in a column separator by a divider at 50% of the page width (left column being in English and right column being in Hindi or other languages).

Fixed scroll bar not appearing in `Pattern Config`'s selector when there are many configs in list.

Fixed `Pattern Based Cropper`'s `Save As` dialog not loading current config name to name's input box .

Fixed an issue where scroll bar was scrolling whole website content.

Refined layout of Pattern Based Cropper's Manage DB Dialog.
