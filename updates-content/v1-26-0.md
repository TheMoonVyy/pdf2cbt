### Added a new Updates Page

This page will notify when there are updates by showing indicator (color) or/and
showing a small popup on updates page button available in the top nav bar.

The updates page has 2 sections:
- **Development**: Here there will be updates regarding current progress of the feature being worked on, etc. Basically a Dev blog-like.
- **Releases**: Will contain release notes.
Up till v1.25.0, all release notes were changelogs which are devs centeric.
From v1.26.0 onwards, release notes will be user friendly with instructions/additional info of the updates which will be shown in this updates page.

For release update, the indicator will be in green color.
For development updates, it will be in yellow color.

You can turn off the popup and indicator from showing from settings (top-right button on top nav bar).

For those using pdf2cbt locally (by downloading the pdf2cbt.zip file from github releases),
this feature will periodically check for release updates and notify you if found.
This is the only feature that uses internet in local version.
If you don't want it to check for updates, turn off indicator and popup of Releases/Development from settings.
