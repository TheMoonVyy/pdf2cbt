### Added feature to re-evaluate test in Test Results page and new config option for Pattern Cropper

Until now, after a test was evaluated in the `Test Results` page,
there was no way to re-evaluate it with a different or updated answer key.

Now there is! Here’s how you can re-evaluate a test:

1. On the `Test Results` page, click on **My Tests** from the left sidebar.
2. Click on the **three vertical dots icon** on the top-right corner of the test card you want to re-evaluate.
3. From the dropdown menu, select **Re-evaluate Results**.
4. A dialog asking for the answer key data will appear:
   - If you already have the new answer key file, simply upload it.
   - Otherwise, click the **Generate Answer Key** link in that dialog to pre-fill existing answers from the test, which you can then edit.
     After editing, download the updated answer key and upload it in the dialog.

Once done, the test will be re-evaluated using the new answer key, and the updated results will appear instantly.

### Added new config option: `Calculate Character Boundaries Precisely` for Pattern Based Cropper

By default, the character boundaries are calculated using font metrics, meaning their bounding boxes are estimated from the font’s reported dimensions and spacing.
This method is **fast** and works well for most PDFs.

However, when text lines are closely spaced (close to each other), these estimated boundaries can slightly overlap, leading to **inaccurate crop detection** in the Pattern Based Cropper.

When the **Calculate Character Boundaries Precisely** option is turned **on**, boundaries are calculated directly from each character’s **glyph** (the actual visual shape of a letter or symbol as it appears on the page).
This allows the cropper to determine the boundaries from the **true drawn shape** of each character instead of rough font-based estimates, giving **much more accurate separation** between closely spaced text lines.

If the text lines in your PDF aren’t very close to each other, it’s recommended to **keep this option off**.
